# tts-workshop-items

Collection of my tabletop simulator workshop items

This collection can be found at https://steamcommunity.com/id/KlutzyBubbles/myworkshopfiles/?appid=286160

## Why dont I use in-game hosting

There are many reasons

- Steam URLs are unique, which is good for self made manual entry but sucks for theme configs (switching the model texture with scripts)
- I have seen too many good workshop items get lost due to an inactive steam account or just removed by the author, at least here people can easily clone if i become inactive.
- I am able to update any mistakes with textures or objects without updating the workshop item (which is a manual and hard to track process)
- Change tracking on git is just better.


## Need / want something changed?

Feel free to submit an issue or add me on steam (https://steamcommunity.com/id/KlutzyBubbles) or discord (@KlutzyBubbles)

I am always interested in adding different themes / features to more workshop items.
